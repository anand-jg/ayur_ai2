# AI Decision Points Documentation

This document outlines the key decision points where AI assistance is required and how these decisions should be handled.

## Decision Point Categories

### 1. UI/UX Decisions
- **When to Ask**: Major UI changes, new feature implementations, user flow modifications
- **Decision Process**:
  1. Present 2-3 alternative approaches
  2. List pros and cons for each
  3. Include user impact analysis
  4. Provide implementation complexity assessment

### 2. Feature Implementation
- **When to Ask**: New feature development, major refactoring, performance optimization
- **Decision Process**:
  1. Present technical approaches
  2. Analyze scalability implications
  3. Consider maintenance overhead
  4. Evaluate security implications

### 3. AI Integration
- **When to Ask**: New AI model integration, prompt engineering, response handling
- **Decision Process**:
  1. Model selection criteria
  2. Integration approach
  3. Error handling strategy
  4. Performance optimization

### 4. Security Decisions
- **When to Ask**: Authentication changes, data handling, API security
- **Decision Process**:
  1. Security implications
  2. Compliance requirements
  3. Implementation complexity
  4. Maintenance overhead

## Decision Point Examples

### Example 1: User Authentication Flow
**Decision Required**: Choose between JWT or Session-based authentication

**Approaches**:
1. JWT-based Authentication
   - Pros:
     - Stateless
     - Scalable
     - Mobile-friendly
   - Cons:
     - Token revocation complexity
     - Larger token size
     - Security considerations

2. Session-based Authentication
   - Pros:
     - Simpler implementation
     - Better control over sessions
     - Easier token revocation
   - Cons:
     - Stateful
     - Server memory usage
     - Scaling challenges

**Recommendation**: JWT-based authentication for scalability and mobile support

### Example 2: Question Tree Implementation
**Decision Required**: Choose between static or dynamic question tree

**Approaches**:
1. Static Question Tree
   - Pros:
     - Faster response time
     - Simpler implementation
     - Easier to maintain
   - Cons:
     - Less flexible
     - Harder to update
     - Limited personalization

2. Dynamic Question Tree
   - Pros:
     - Highly personalized
     - Easy to update
     - Better user experience
   - Cons:
     - More complex implementation
     - Higher resource usage
     - More maintenance required

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach with static base tree and dynamic branches

## Decision Documentation Format

Each decision should be documented in the following format:

```markdown
### Decision: [Decision Title]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Context**: [Brief description of the situation]
**Options Considered**: [List of options]
**Decision**: [Chosen option]
**Rationale**: [Reasoning behind the decision]
**Impact**: [Expected impact on the system]
**Review Date**: [Date for decision review]
```

## AI Decision Making Guidelines

1. **When to Make Decisions**:
   - Only for significant architectural changes
   - When multiple valid approaches exist
   - When decision impacts user experience
   - When security is a concern

2. **When Not to Make Decisions**:
   - Routine code maintenance
   - Minor UI tweaks
   - Performance optimizations with clear best practices
   - Standard security implementations

3. **Decision Quality Criteria**:
   - Clear documentation
   - Measurable impact
   - Reversible if needed
   - Aligned with project goals

4. **Decision Review Process**:
   - Regular review of decisions
   - Performance impact analysis
   - User feedback consideration
   - Technical debt assessment
