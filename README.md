# AyurAI - AI-Powered Ayurvedic Healthcare Platform

## Project Overview
AyurAI is a web application that combines traditional Ayurvedic knowledge with modern AI technology to provide personalized healthcare recommendations and doctor matching services.

## Architecture

### Frontend (React.js)
- Modern, responsive UI built with React.js
- State management using Redux Toolkit
- Component-based architecture for easy maintenance
- AI-driven UI decisions through decision points system

### Backend (Django)
- RESTful API architecture
- Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- PostgreSQL database
- AI integration layer for decision making
- Recommendation engine for doctor matching

## Core Features

### User Authentication
- Role-based authentication (User/Doctor)
- Secure session management
- Profile management

### Decision Tree System
- Dynamic question-answer flow
- AI-powered path determination
- Response collection and analysis
- Root cause identification

### AI Integration
- Decision points system for critical choices
- Automated maintenance suggestions
- AI-driven code generation for routine tasks
- Smart prompt generation for healthcare recommendations

### Doctor Recommendation System
- Profile matching algorithm
- Specialization-based filtering
- Location-based recommendations
- Rating and review system

## AI Integration Points

### Decision Points System
The application includes specific decision points where AI assistance is required for:
1. UI/UX design decisions
2. Feature implementation approaches
3. Performance optimization strategies
4. Security considerations

Each decision point will:
- Present multiple approaches
- List pros and cons
- Suggest recommended path
- Document the decision

### Automated Maintenance
- AI-driven code review
- Automated testing suggestions
- Performance monitoring
- Security vulnerability detection

## Scaling Considerations

### Frontend
- Component-based architecture for easy updates
- Lazy loading for better performance
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Micro-frontend ready architecture

### Backend
- Microservices-ready architecture
- Horizontal scaling support
- Caching strategies
- Database optimization

### AI Integration
- Modular AI decision system
- Easy integration of new AI models
- Scalable prompt management
- Performance monitoring

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow component-based architecture
- Implement proper error handling
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Use consistent coding standards

### AI Integration
- Document all decision points
- Maintain clear AI decision logs
